# Terraform Training

Welcome to the Terraform Training repository! This is a private repository created for the purpose of practicing and enhancing skills in using Terraform, a powerful tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

## Objective

The primary objective of this repository is to serve as a platform for learning and experimenting with Terraform. Here, I aim to strengthen my understanding and expertise in various Terraform functionalities.

## Projects and Exercises

In this repository, I will be working on a range of exercises to develop my skills in managing and orchestrating infrastructure using Terraform. Some of the key projects include:

1. **Launching EC2 Instances**: Learning to automate the deployment of EC2 instances in AWS. This will involve understanding the necessary configurations and resources in Terraform to manage EC2 instances effectively.

2. **User Management for Enterprise Tools**: Implementing user creation scripts for enterprise tools such as Jira, Confluence, and Mattermost. This will help in understanding how to manage users and permissions in a corporate environment using Terraform.

3. **Email Server Configuration**: Setting up and managing an email server for organizational use. This includes creating and configuring email accounts, along with managing the necessary infrastructure through Terraform.

## Learning Journey

As I progress through these exercises, I will document my learning journey, challenges faced, and solutions found. This documentation will not only serve as a personal reference but also as a guide for others who are on a similar path of learning Terraform.

## Contributions and Suggestions

While this is a personal learning repository, suggestions and advice from fellow Terraform practitioners are always welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have ideas on how to improve the exercises or if you have additional challenges that I can try.
